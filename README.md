# NYT Challenge

## Overview
Browse the New York Times Top Stories for the day, see details, and sort by categories.

## Purpose
This application was built as part of an interview simulation. Given eight hours, developers were tasked with building a website that displays NYT articles from the NYT API. This project aims to teach new developers how to speak to their process for decision making and delivering a viable MVP within the time constraints of the assignment.
